# Creating a React App with CRA

- `create-react-app` not only creates a React app for you, it also creates the folder for your app. There is no need to create one beforehand. CRA uses the project name you specify in the `npx create-react-app <your-project-name>` command.
- CRA also initializes a Git repository for you, as well as a `.gitignore` file.
- If you are zipping your project up for assignment submission, **please make sure to remove the `node_modules` folder beforehand**. [Here is a video](https://youtu.be/KD6Y6G6-Qs0) from Instructor Heidi with detailed instructions.
